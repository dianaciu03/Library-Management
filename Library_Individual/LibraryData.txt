Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</description><genre>Romance</genre><isbn>9780679783268</isbn><loanHistory/><numberOfPages>279</numberOfPages><publicationDate>2000-10-10T00:00:00</publicationDate><title>Pride and Prejudice</title></Book><Book><author>F.

Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.&#xD;
When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work.&#xD;
Dare to Lead answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme.</description><genre>NonFiction</genre><isbn>9781473562523</isbn><loanHistory/><numberOfPages>332</numberOfPages><publicationDate>2018-10-11T00:00:00</publicationDate><title>Dare to Lead</title></Book><Book><author>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</author><currentLoan i:nil="true"/><description>A pilot stranded in the desert awakes one morning to see, standing before him, the most extraordinary little fellow.

Eminescu (1850-1889) was a complex personality; at once a philosopher, politician, journalist, and prose writer, but above all a poet -- he is 'an expression of the Romanian soul'. The selection in this volume includes English language versions of some of Eminescu's best-known poems and is illustrated with original drawings by the Romanian artist A Bordenache and graphics from the princeps edition of Eminescu's poems published in 1883.</description><genre>Poetry</genre><isbn>9789739432108</isbn><loanHistory/><numberOfPages>240</numberOfPages><publicationDate>2000-05-01T00:00:00</publicationDate><title>Poems and Prose</title></Book><Book><author>Walter Isaacson</author><currentLoan i:nil="true"/><description>Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.</description><genre>Biography</genre><isbn>9781451648539</isbn><loanHistory/><numberOfPages>630</numberOfPages><publicationDate>2011-10-24T00:00:00</publicationDate><title>Steve Jobs</title></Book><Book><author>J.K.

As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.&#xD;

The authors also shed new light on many unexplored aspects of Van Gogh’s inner world: his erratic and tumultuous romantic life; his bouts of depression and mental illness; and the cloudy circumstances surrounding his death at the age of thirty-seven.</description><genre>Biography</genre><isbn>9780375758973</isbn><loanHistory/><numberOfPages>976</numberOfPages><publicationDate>2012-12-04T00:00:00</publicationDate><title>Van Gogh: The Life</title></Book><Book><author>Emil M.
